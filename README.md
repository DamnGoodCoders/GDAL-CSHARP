## Committing instructions:

All features should have their own branch.  These all should be branched from the Development branch.  

Never merge a feature directly into the Master branch.  First, create a pull request to the Development branch, then we will merge the two.  Only merge the Development branch to the Master branch.

If you're creating a feature, call the branch "feature/feature-name."  Same goes with bugfixes: "bug-fix/issue-name."  Reference the issue you are fixing in your commit.

Once we get the ball rolling, we should require everyone to approve pull requests to the development branch, thoroughly reviewing the changes.
